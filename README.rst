mercurial-hug
=============

This library provides a wrapper around select Mercurial functionality. We aim for the wrapper to be
friendlier to use than Mercurial itself (the libraries, that is, which are largely undocumented) and
also to provide a stable API. To achieve this, we will implement *only* the functionality we need,
and if you ask nicely we might also implement the functionality you need too.

Also, Mercurial is licensed under the GPLv2+ and we use it under the terms of the GPLv3. This project
is licensed according to the AGPLv3+, so if you're looking for a cushion from the strict copyleft
license, this library is not your answer.

Hosted on GitHub?!
------------------
I know it's a little weird to host a project about Mercurial in a Git repository, but BitBucket is
not impressive, and basically I didn't think it was worth off-GitHub hosting just for this small
library. Sorry!
